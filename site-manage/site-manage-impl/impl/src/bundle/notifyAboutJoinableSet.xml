			Dear ${userName},

			Joinable Set "${jSetName}" has been &lt;#if isNew == "true"&gt;created &lt;#else&gt;updated &lt;/#if&gt;on the following ${localSakaiName} site: ${siteName}.

			It can have several associated groups, you can join one of them.
			Each group title is composed by the Joinable Set name followed with a number (e.g ${jSetName} 1).
			Each group has space for ${maxUsers} member(s).
			&lt;#if openDate??&gt;

			Available from: ${openDate}
			&lt;/#if&gt;
			&lt;#if closeDate??&gt;

			Enrollment ends: ${closeDate}
			&lt;/#if&gt;
			&lt;#if canUnjoin == "true"&gt;

			Ability to unjoin is active&lt;#if closeDate??&gt; until closing date&lt;/#if&gt;.
			&lt;#else&gt;

			Ability to unjoin is not active.
